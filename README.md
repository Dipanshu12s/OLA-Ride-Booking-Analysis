# OLA Ride Booking Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes ride booking data from OLA, a popular ride-hailing service, to extract valuable business insights using SQL queries. The database captures details such as bookings, vehicle types, ride distances, cancellations, rider and driver ratings, payment methods, and booking values.

## Database Setup
- The project uses a database named `ola`.  
- The main table is `bookings`, which holds detailed records for each ride booking.

## Key Queries and Insights
Here are some of the important analyses performed in this project:
- Retrieve all successful bookings to understand completed rides.
- Calculate average ride distance per vehicle type to identify usage trends.
- Count total rides cancelled by customers.
- Identify the top 3 customers who booked the highest number of rides.
- Count rides cancelled by drivers due to personal or car-related issues.
- Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings specifically for Prime Sedan vehicle type.
- Retrieve all rides where payments were made using UPI.
- Calculate the average customer rating by vehicle type.
- Calculate the total booking value of successfully completed rides.
- List all incomplete rides along with their reasons to identify service issues.

## How to Use This Project
1. Run the provided SQL script to create the `ola` database and the `bookings` table.  
2. Insert your ride booking data into the `bookings` table.  
3. Execute the SQL queries included in the script to generate insights.

## Benefits
This project helps to:
- Analyze customer behavior and ride preferences,
- Evaluate vehicle and driver performance through rating metrics,
- Monitor payment method trends,
- Understand cancellations and incomplete rides,
- Measure overall business metrics like total booking value.

By leveraging these insights, ride-hailing businesses can optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
